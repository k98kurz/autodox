# Autodox

Tool for generating documentation automatically from code annotations, types,
and docstrings.

## Status

- [x] Code
- [x] Docs
- [x] Package published
- [x] Denote async functions as such

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
pip install autodox
```

Note that Protocols do not support `__init__` methods before Python 3.11. To use
`__init__` method signatures for Protocols in Python 3.10, use the
`typing.Protocol` backport from the 3rd-party `typing_extensions` package.
Otherwise, the `__init__` method signature will be overridden with an empty one
named `_no_init_or_replace_init` and will be ignored by this tool.

### Document a module from CLI

Use the following to document a module with default configuration:

```bash
autodox module_name [options] > target_file.md
```

The output can be configured with the following options:
- `-exclude_name=name` to exclude a specific part of the module by name
- `-exclude_type=type` to exclude any module parts of the given type
- `-package=module_name` to scope a relative import
- `-header_level=number` to increase the hashtag count in headers by `number`
- `-function_format=format` - can be one of 'header', 'paragraph', or 'list'
- `-method_format=format` - can be one of 'header', 'paragraph', or 'list'
- `-value_format=format` - can be one of 'header', 'paragraph', or 'list'
- `-line_length=number` - number of chars per line in paragraphs
- `-include_private` to include things prefaced with '_'
- `-include_dunder` to include things prefaced with '__'
- `-include_submodules` to include submodules
- `-document_submodules` to run the module documentation for submodules
- `-debug` to increase the level of debug statements printed (starts at 0)

For experimentation and to learn how the options work, try running the following:

```bash
autodox autodox [options]
```

### Programmatic access

The autodox package can also be used by importing and running the desired
documentation function(s). The following are included.

- `dox_a_module(module: ModuleType, options: dict = None) -> str` produces docs for a module
- `dox_a_value(value: Any, options: dict = None) -> str` produces docs for a value
- `dox_a_function(function: Callable, options: dict = None) -> str` produces docs for a function
- `dox_a_class(cls: type, options: dict = None) -> str` produces docs for a class

The valid options for each will be described below. Additionally, there is a
system for setting up hooks that interact with the doc generation process to
change the inputs or outputs, and that will be described below the options for
the four `dox_a_{thing}` functions.

#### `dox_a_module(module: ModuleType, options: dict = None) -> str`

Produces docs for a module. Valid options are the following:

- `exclude_names: list[str]` - names to exclude from docs
- `exclude_types: list[str]` - types to exclude from docs
- `header_level: int` - number of additional hashtags to add to headers
- `include_private: bool` - if True, includes things with names prefaced by '_'
- `include_dunder: bool` - if True, includes things with names prefaced by '__'
- `include_submodules: bool` - if True, notes will be made about any additional
modules encountered when analyzing the specified module
- `document_submodules: bool` - if True, `dox_a_module` will be called
recursively on any additional modules encountered when analyzing the specified
module

#### `dox_a_value(value: Any, options: dict = None) -> str`

Produces docs for a value. Valid options are the following:

- `header_level: int` - number of additional hashtags to add to headers
- `format: str` - format can be one of 'header', 'paragraph', or 'list'

#### `dox_a_function(function: Callable, options: dict = None) -> str`

Produces docs for a function. Valid options are the following:

- `header_level: int` - number of additional hashtags to add to headers

#### `dox_a_class(cls: type, options: dict = None) -> str`

Produces docs for a class. Valid options are the following:

- `exclude_names: list[str]` - names to exclude from docs
- `header_level: int` - number of additional hashtags to add to headers
- `include_private: bool` - if True, includes things with names prefaced by '_'
- `include_dunder: bool` - if True, includes things with names prefaced by '__'
- `method_format: str` - can be one of 'header', 'paragraph', or 'list'

#### Hooks

There are eight events where custom functionality can be run, specified in the
`Event` enum:
- `AFTER_HEADER`
- `AFTER_PARAGRAPH`
- `AFTER_LIST`
- `BEFORE_VALUE`
- `AFTER_VALUE`
- `BEFORE_FUNCTION`
- `AFTER_FUNCTION`
- `BEFORE_CLASS`
- `AFTER_CLASS`
- `BEFORE_MODULE`
- `AFTER_MODULE`

Handlers for the `BEFORE_` events can be set using the `set_before_handler`
function. These handlers will receive the item to be documented and a dict
containing any options passed into the `dox_a_{thing}` function, and they should
return a tuple containing those two arguments after any modifications are made
to them. Example:

```python
from autodox import Event, set_before_handler
from typing import Callable


def handle_before_function(function: Callable, options: dict):
    # set an option
    options['header_level'] = 2
    return (function, options)

set_before_handler(Event.BEFORE_FUNCTION, handle_before_function)
```

Handlers for the `AFTER_` events can be set using the `set_after_handler`
function. These handlers will receive the str doc after the `dox_a_{thing}`
function has completed executing, and they should return that document after any
modifications are made. Example:

```python
from autodox import Event, set_after_handler


def handle_after_function(doc: str):
    # do some string manipulation
    return doc + 'But really, why would you call this function anyway?\n\n'

set_after_handler(Event.AFTER_FUNCTION, handle_after_function)
```

Muliple handlers can be set for each event, and they will be executed in order,
passing the output from the first as input to the second, etc. Example:

```python
from autodox import Event, set_after_handler


# add 'hello world' to the end of each list item in two steps
def hello(doc: str):
    return doc + ' hello'

def world(doc: str):
    return doc + ' world'

set_after_handler(Event.AFTER_LIST, hello)
set_after_handler(Event.AFTER_LIST, world)
```


## Testing

The test suite for this library is currently limited to hooks (14 tests) and a
few edge cases I encountered using the package (12 tests).

To test, clone the repository and run the following:

```
python test_hooks.py
python test_doxing.py
```
